 RANDOM NAME GENERATOR
-----------------------
This program generates a random first name and last name that can be inserted in a SQL Server database table with Person_ID, FirstName and LastName attributes.
This can convert the names into an SQL-ready query (output in C:\output.txt) that you can copy and paste to your MS Server Query.
This can also insert the names generated straight into your MS SQL Server database table and read the contents of your database table.

NOTE: You can add more names in arry or add more database table attributes by editing ServerConnection.cs
